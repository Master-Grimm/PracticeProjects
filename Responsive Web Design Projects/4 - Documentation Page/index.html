        <p>In the early 1960s, Soviet scientist Aleksandr Leonovitch Granin created designs for a REX-like bipedal tank. However, Colonel Volgin of GRU rejected his ideas in favor of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov's Shagohod. Drunk and bitter, Granin sent his designs to an American colleague, revealing this to CIA operative Naked Snake during Operation Snake Eater. Later, triple spy Ocelot also stole and delivered duplicate designs to his CIA superiors. The Soviets also researched ways to launch an untraceable missile since 1964.</p>

        <p>The duplicate designs would later served as the inspiration for the Intercontinental Ballistic Metal Gear. The development of REX itself was foreseen in a psychic premonition by Elisa and Ursula during the San Hieronymo Incident in 1970.</p>    
        
        <code>Unoffical information ends here</code>      
        
        <p>The designs also served as the inspiration for the Chrysalis, Peace Walker, and Metal Gear ZEKE in the early 1970s as well as Metal Gear Sahelanthropus in 1984.</p>            
        <p>Some time after Solid Snake's encounters with TX-55 Metal Gear in 1995 and Metal Gear D in 1999, an attempt to carry out a Metal Gear project within the United States had been planned but was officially scrapped yet convinced the private weapons company ArmsTech that building one for the U.S. Army would be a very profitable venture. ArmsTech had been in a dire state financially, with the possibility of a hostile takeover becoming apparent after failing to obtain a contract on a new line of fighter jet for the U.S. Air Force. Likewise, the Department of Defense agreed to its development due to the defense budget being slashed by 15% and thus being forced to allow the private sector to develop their weapons for them.</p>

        <p>In 2002, DARPA Chief Donald Anderson was heavily bribed by ArmsTech to back the Metal Gear REX project. For several years, regular payments in the tens of thousands of dollars were made to the corporate account of a dummy company for which his wife ostensibly acted as a consultant. DARPA funded REX's development covertly, using part of the United States' black budget. After the cancellation of the Arsenal Ship Project in 1996 following the death of the 25th Chief of Naval Operations, the budget had freed up, allowing the REX project to proceed undelayed. Though the CNO's death was officially ruled as suicide, rumors to the contrary circulated at the time.</p>
  
        <p>The nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island was constructed to conceal the development of Metal Gear REX. Its rail gun was based on technology developed for the SDI, having been successfully miniaturized in a joint venture between ArmsTech and Livermore National Labs. Livermore also developed a new type of nuclear weapon for REX using NOVA and NIF laser nuclear fusion testing equipment and supercomputers.</p>
        
        <p>One of the main goals of developing REX was to overcome a global trend in military downsizing at the time. A weapon such as REX would cause an immediate rift in the global power structure. REX was a self-mobile launch platform capable of using its massive rail gun to launch a nuclear warhead contained projectile package with a low radar cross-section, and without the need for a rocket propulsion system, the launch event was also undetectable by satellite thermal imaging unlike the massive heat signature characteristic of ICBM launches. It could give any country in the world a first-strike capability that other nations would find hard to counter. This also exploited a specific loophole that existed in anti-nuke treaties, since projectiles fired from a rail gun were not technically ICBMs, so the START treaties imposing limitations on ballistic missiles did not apply.</p>
        
        <p>During REX's development, the Metal Gear engineers became concerned of what would happen if REX, after it was completed and doing solo ops in the field, was detected by the enemy and forced to engage in close range combat against conventional forces. They then decided that they could make REX's hull a weapon in itself. Although the program was completed, and had gotten fantastic results from supercomputer simulation, the military shelved the project before they could even install it (as the military viewed it as not being part of their regulations). However, REX's chief engineer Hal Emmerich secretly uploaded the data into REX anyway. Although the first actual prototype for REX was developed in 2005, it went through multiple prototype stages in VR while it was still in the design stage to correct various flaws before being developed. As REX was primarily tested via VR simulations, the Pentagon and ArmsTech needed to perform live testing to compare the simulation data with actual test results. Because of this, they started a field exercise at the remote military facility on Shadow Moses Island.</p>

      <p>Metal Gear REX is named after the Tyrannosaurus rex, due to its theropod-like design; other similarities include the open cockpit's resemblance to a gaping mouth, along with its ability to roar. The word Rex itself is Latin for "King," which was also the Allied codename used for the Japanese Kawanishi N1K floatplane during World War II.</p>

      <article>    
      <p>Metal Gear REX is operated by a single pilot within a completely self-enclosed cockpit, shut off from the outside environment. The radome on REX's left arm houses multiple electronic sensors that are connected to a high tech virtual reality interface within the pilot's seat. Destruction of the radome, however, cuts off the sensory data feed and renders the VR interface inoperative, forcing the pilot to manually operate REX by opening the cockpit, which also exposed it to enemy fire. This flaw was deliberately engineered by Otacon during development, as he felt it wouldn't truly be complete without a weakness or "character flaw" of some sort.</p>

        <p>REX differed from earlier Metal Gear models in that its legs were heavily armored and reinforced; not vulnerable like its predecessors. Along with near-impenetrable compound armor (of which only HEAT weapons could deal sufficient damage), REX also had a pair of 30mm, XGAU-8R rotary cannons, AGM-114P anti-tank missiles, and a free-electron variant of the Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser (MTHEL-FE) to protect itself from conventional forces. Its feet also possessed retractable metal stake-like protrusions, which were used to find purchase on difficult terrain, and could be employed in "stomp" attacks on an enemy.</p>
        
        <p>The AGM-114P anti-tank missiles, launched from both of REX's knees and back, were a laser semi-active homing type that didn't use wires. The launchers used a low-powered laser illuminator to bounce a coded laser beam off a target that the missile would then home in on. The free-electron laser cannon mounted on REX's belly was capable of generating almost 100 megawatts of energy, ten times greater than any other laser at that time.</p>
        
        <p>REX's most fearsome weapon, however, was the magnetic rail gun capable of delivering an untraceable nuclear warhead anywhere in the world, without the propellant trail or launch flare that gives away the launch position of a traditional ballistic missile. By perfecting the process of electromagnetic acceleration, the rail gun is able to fire a projectile with a muzzle velocity of over 100 kilometers per second. It was apparently originally going to be used, as part of SDI, to shoot down enemy ICBMs outside the atmosphere. Otacon stated that when fired outside the atmosphere, REX's nuclear rounds would have a radius of effect of 300 meters, and the gun would be sufficiently accurate to hit a satellite traveling at 10 kilometers per second. The rail gun's feature was also implied by ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker to be illegal, and that were it to be discovered, his company would most likely end up shut down and Baker himself would most likely face an inquiry.</p>
        
        <p>During the Guns of the Patriots Incident, Otacon revealed to Old Snake that he had installed a "Street Fighter" software control program into REX that gave it not only an agility boost, but enabled the Metal Gear to execute kicking and other melee moves, which would be lethal to many military vehicles and other Metal Gears such as Metal Gear RAY. This program was one of REX's most lethal weapons compared to its other conventional warfare weapons, as military vehicles and Metal Gears were designed with countermeasures against conventional armaments, but not the raw brute force of these attacks. However, the program was secretly installed into REX and the only person who knew of its existence was Otacon, which turned out to be an advantage both times it was faced in battle; neither Liquid Snake nor Ocelot could respectively use or defend against it.</p>
