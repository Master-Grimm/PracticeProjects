          Solid Snake, real name David, also known as Old Snake, and briefly
          known as Iroquois Pliskin, or simply Snake, was a former spy, special
          operations soldier, and mercenary. Possessing an IQ of 180 and fluent
          in six languages, the fame he achieved from his military exploits
          earned him such monikers as "Legendary Soldier,", "Legendary Hero,"
          and "the Man Who Makes the Impossible Possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          Snake was one of the children born of the 1972 project Les Enfants
          Terribles. He was created as a clone of the world-renowned soldier Big
          Boss, along with his brothers Liquid Snake and Solidus Snake.
          Initially a Green Beret, Snake was later inducted into the High-Tech
          Special Forces Unit FOXHOUND in the 1990s while it was commanded by
          Big Boss. Repeatedly tasked with disarming and destroying the latest
          incarnation of Metal Gear, a bipedal nuclear weapon-armed tank, Snake
          would thrice avert potential nuclear catastrophe, becoming a famed war
          hero.

          Following the Shadow Moses Incident and subsequent smear campaign by
          the Patriots, the secret organization behind American politics, Snake
          was labeled a terrorist. He faked his own death in the Manhattan
          Tanker Incident, though he re-emerged years later to assist Raiden in
          the Big Shell Incident. During this time, his body entered a state of
          accelerated aging, due to intentional genetic changes made during the
          cloning process, causing his health to decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, Snake performed his final mission, during which he defeated
          Liquid Ocelot and destroyed the Patriots. After one last encounter
          with Big Boss, Snake chose to live his remaining days in peace.
